# Lottery

I built the Crypto Lottery to get my feet wet with blockchain development. This app comes with self-written, Mocha-tested smart contracts deployed to Rinkeby and Mumbai test networks. I used Hardhat.js to manage the backend and React.js on the front-end with Moralis to interact with the blockchains.
